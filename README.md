 # Movie Recommmendation System
Movie Recommendation system is a system that provides movie suggestions to users based on some dataset. Such a 
system will predict what movies a user will like based on the attributes of previously liked movies by that user.
</br>
To understand movie recommendations in a little depth we need to understand the two broad types of recommendation systems which are: Content 
Based and Collaborative based recommendation systems. My website is based on content which is first one, I will explain both of these:)

# 1. Content Based Recommendation System:
 It uses attributes such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make suggestions for the users. The intuition behind this sort of recommendation system is that if a user liked a particular movie or show, he/she might like a movie or a show similar to it.


</br></br>

# 2. Collaborative Based Recommendation System:
It matches users with same interests and gives recommendations based on their likes. Eg: There are two users Sam and Robin, Sam likes movies A,B,C,D and Robin likes movies C,D. Since movies C,D are common to both Sam and Robin, thus movies A and B would be recommended to Robin. Collaborative filtering does not make use of metadata to give recommendations.

# Importance:
Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in today’s extremely busy world. People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices,without having to expend their cognitive resources.  
</br></br>

Recommender systems can be a very powerful tool in a company’s arsenal, and future developments are going to increase business value even further. 
Some of the applications include being able to anticipate seasonal purchases based on recommendations, determine important purchases, and give better recommendations to customers which can increase retention and brand loyalty.

# Advantages:
1) It overcomes the cold start problem i.e even if the database does not contain user preferences it still shows recommendations to users.
2) It easily adjusts its recommendations as the user changes preferences.
3) User similarity is not available hence no profile sharing is present, so privacy is maintained.
</br></br>

# Objective of the code:
To make a web based application for movie recommendation system.
</br></br>

# Functionality about the website:
1) You have good movies at the top and you can search for your desired movies
2) On hovering over one of the video give you the overview page
3) On clicking Know more your overlay window opens to present you the youtube videos
4) You can click over the tags present at the top and can search for a movie with the particular combination of features/tags
5) You can sign up in the bottom and your data is printed in the console
6) Every link is functionable and have particular role
</br></br>

# Pre-requisite to run the application: 
Vs Code Editor with Live Server Extension
</br></br>

# Future Scope of this project:
It was a learning project about recommendation system. This caode can be modified to dynamic web application for any real world recommendation system for example: Book recommendation, project recommendation, fashion recommenation, image recommendation etc. And by using some extra back-end
programming we can make it more interactive, creative and responsive fullstack project  that will help to grow faster in business/startup.
</br></br>

# Conclusion:
Content based recommendation system is certainly good if we want to recommend suggestions based on features like genres, actors, overview etc.. The accuracy of content based filtering enhances when we use fields such as genres, cast, crews which provide more in depth information about the user’s likes. The most basic form of recommendation system is based on Demographic filtering which just makes use of fields like popularity, budget and revenue, these fields don’t provide any specific information which could help us in determining the preferences/likes of user. Some limitations of content based filtering are that it can only make recommendations based on existing interests of the user, it does not consider the fact that what do other users think of an item, thus low quality item recommendations may occur sometimes.
